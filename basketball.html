   <li><h3><u><b>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h3></u></b><br>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar deserves the title of being the one of the best playerx to ever play the game of basketball in my opinion for one reason alone: 
his implementation and later perfection of the sky hook shot.
No other player in the history of the game has come close to developing a shot that is more lethal and more effective in crunch-time situations, than the Sky hook shot.
And no other offensive weapon was more reliable when it was needed the most. 
Furthermore, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky hook shot has not been duplicated like the dunk or the finger roll have been, and this puts Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in a class all by himself.
Because Kareem could use the sky hook with equal effectiveness with either his right or his left hand, and from any distance from the basket, it has basically transcended any 
element of the game of basketball that came after it. 
Now, top this all off with the fact that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored more points (38,387) and had greater longevity in a career that spanned over 21 seasons,
makes it hard to find a better argument.  Karl Malone's 36,928 points and Michael Jordan's 32,292 points keeps one of those players (Jordan) in the conversation for the all-time best.

   <li><h3><u><b>LeBron James</h3></u></b><br>
     <p> LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
       Nicknamed "King James", he is widely considered one of the greatest players ever and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.
       James has won four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA Finals MVP awards, three All-Star MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. James has scored the most points in the playoffs,
       the most career points (playoffs and regular seasons combined), and the second most regular seasons points, and has the seventh most career assists. 
       He has been selected an NBA All-Star 18 times, to the All-NBA Team a record 18 times, and to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times.
       He has competed in ten NBA Finals, the third most all time, including eight consecutively between 2011 and 2018. In 2021, James was selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team,
       and in 2022 became the first and only player in NBA history to accumulate over 10,000 career points, rebounds, and assists.</p></li> <br>

   <li><h3><u><b> Michael Jordan </h3></u></b> <br>
   <p>By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.
     Although, a summary of his basketball career and influence on the game inevitably fails to do it justice, as a phenomenal athlete with a unique combination of fundamental soundness, grace, speed, power, artistry, improvisational ability and an unquenchable competitive desire, Jordan single-handedly redefined the NBA superstar.
     Even contemporaneous superstars recognized the unparalleled position of Jordan. Magic Johnson said, “There’s Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.” 
     Larry Bird, following a playoff game where Jordan dropped 63 points on the Boston Celtics in just his second season, appraisal of the young player was: “God disguised as Michael Jordan.”
     A brief listing of his top accomplishments would include the following: Rookie of the Year; Five-time NBA MVP; Six-time NBA champion; Six-time NBA Finals MVP;
     Ten-time All-NBA First Team; Nine time NBA All-Defensive First Team; Defensive Player of the Year; 14-time NBA All-Star; Three-time NBA All-Star MVP; 
     50th Anniversary All-Time Team; Ten scoring titles — an NBA record and seven consecutive matching Wilt Chamberlain;
     Retired with the NBA’s highest scoring average of 30.1ppg; Hall of Fame inductee.</p></li><br>
