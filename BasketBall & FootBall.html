  <p> <h4 style = 'font-family : 'times new roman';'> Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to propel the ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. 
  The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing side's rectangular framed goal. 
  Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45 minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. The football world cup(fifa world cup) is played internationaly.
  There is also a premier league, which is a contested between 20 clubs.
  With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries, it is considered the world's most popular sport. 
  Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of known as the football  
  Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. 
  The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw.
The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play,
  though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body 
  (notably, "heading" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms. Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch,
  though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.</p></h4>

  <p> <h4 style = 'font-family : 'times new roman';'> Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball 
   through the defender's hoop high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. 
  A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
  After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.
  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill.
  On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots;
  either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
  It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.><p> <h4>
